<P>Provides an API for plugging in authentication and authorization
for members of a distributed system and clients.

<H3>GemFire security framework</H3>
The security framework tackles two requirements: authentication of nodes
and authorization for operations. The authentication piece deals with
authentication of nodes in a peer-to-peer network as well as of the clients
that connect to the servers.

<I>
It is not our plan to provide a sophisticated security infrastructure
built into GemFire. Most enterprise customers have their own authentication
and entitlement management infrastructure and our plan is make sure the
framework allows application administrators to delegate the responsibility
to external providers.
