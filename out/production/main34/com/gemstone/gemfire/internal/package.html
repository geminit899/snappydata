<H2>Logging</H2>

<P>GemFire provides a {@linkplain com.gemstone.gemfire.LogWriter
logging API} that is similar to the one provided by standard java.
The {@link com.gemstone.gemfire.internal.LogWriterImpl} class provides
implementations of a number of the <code>LogWriter</code> methods.
There is one concrete implementation of <code>LogWriterImpl</code>.
It is {@link com.gemstone.gemfire.internal.LocalLogWriter} that
writes to a VM-local {@link java.io.PrintStream}.</P>

<P>The {@link com.gemstone.gemfire.internal.MergeLogFiles} utility can
be used to merged multiple log files together sorted by the timestamp
of their entries.</P>
