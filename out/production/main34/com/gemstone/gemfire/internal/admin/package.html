<P>Provides an abstract API for the administration (configuring,
starting, and monitoring) of various GemFire components.  This API is
used by tools such as the GemFire Console to obtain information about
the members of a GemFire distributed system.  This package contains
interfaces that specify the behavior of the internal administration
API.  The implementation of these interfaces is in the {@link
com.gemstone.gemfire.internal.admin.remote} package.</P>
