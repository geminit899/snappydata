<P>Provides an API for administering various GemFire components such
as a GemFire distributed
system, and processes that host GemFire Caches.</P>

<H3>Administration of a GemFire Distributed System</H3>

The Admin API provides interfaces for administrative control, 
monitoring, and custom management of a GemFire system.
<P>
The {@link com.gemstone.gemfire.admin.AdminDistributedSystemFactory}
is the starting point.  It creates an instance of
<code>AdminDistributedSystem</code> that administers the distributed
system to which a VM is {@linkplain
com.gemstone.gemfire.distributed.DistributedSystem connected}.
<P>
<pre><code>
DistributedSystem connection = DistributedSystem.connect(new Properties());
AdminDistributedSystem system = 
    AdminDistributedSystemFactory.getDistributedSystem(connection);
system.connect(new File("admin.log"), "info");
</code></pre>
<P>
This {@link com.gemstone.gemfire.admin.AdminDistributedSystem}
interface exposes methods for such tasks as connecting to the system,
merging system logs, getting administrative interfaces to 
applications that host GemFire Caches.

<H3>Monitoring the Health of GemFire</H3>

<P>The {@link com.gemstone.gemfire.admin.GemFireHealth} interface
allows the overall health of GemFire to be monitored.
<code>GemFireHealth</code> monitors the behavior the members of a
distributed system namely 
application VMs that may host {@link com.gemstone.gemfire.cache.Cache
cache} instances.  There are three levels of health: {@linkplain
com.gemstone.gemfire.admin.GemFireHealth#GOOD_HEALTH good health} that
indicates that all GemFire components are behaving reasonably,
{@linkplain com.gemstone.gemfire.admin.GemFireHealth#OKAY_HEALTH okay
health} that indicates that one or more GemFire components is slightly
unhealthy and may need some attention, and {@linkplain
com.gemstone.gemfire.admin.GemFireHealth#POOR_HEALTH poor health} that
indicates that a GemFire component is unhealthy and needs immediate
attention.</P>

<P>Because each GemFire application has its own definition of what it
means to be "healthy", the metrics that are used to determine health
are configurable.  {@link
com.gemstone.gemfire.admin.GemFireHealthConfig} provides methods for
configuring how the health of {@linkplain
com.gemstone.gemfire.admin.DistributedSystemHealthConfig the
distributed system},
{@linkplain com.gemstone.gemfire.admin.CacheHealthConfig members that
host Cache instances}, and {@linkplain
com.gemstone.gemfire.admin.MemberHealthConfig individual members} of
the distributed system.  <code>GemFireHealthConfig</code> also allows
you to configure how often GemFire's health is evaluated.</P>
