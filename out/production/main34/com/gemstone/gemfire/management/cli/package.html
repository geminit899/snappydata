<p>The Command Line Interface (CLI) package provides a set of APIs for writing commands that can be used to manage and monitor GemFire components.
 This interface is currently used by the GemFire SHell (GFSH) command line utility, but may be used to create custom commands which build upon that functionality.</p>
