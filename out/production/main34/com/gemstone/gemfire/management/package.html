<p>A set of APIs for retrieving information and statistics for GemFire components as well as controlling the startup, shutdown and runtime of those components.
 These APIs make use of the Java Management Extension (JMX) framework in order provide a standard interface to this management and monitoring functionality.
 Therefore, off-the-shelf products (such as the JDK's JConsole) may make use of these APIs in order to adapt control of the GemFire product to fit into existing network operation centers.</p>
