Looks at the impact of persistence on creates, using the LargeObject schema.  Compares GFE and GFXD.  Runs with 2 clients and 2 servers.  Uses partitioning and redundance 0 and 1.

This suite runs on monster and does not create enough data to cause the O/S buffers to flush to disk.  So it measures the overhead of persistence exclusive of disk overhead.
