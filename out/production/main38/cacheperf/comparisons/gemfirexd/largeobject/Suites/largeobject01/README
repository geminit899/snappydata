Runs modestly scaled multihost GFE-convertible LargeObject tests with several topologies using GFXD and GFE, and using MYSQLC for thin clients only.  Tables are partitioned by primary key with 1 redundant copy.

The suite can be used to compare:

-- peerClient vs. thinClient for GFE and GFXD

-- GFXD vs. GFE (all topologies)

-- GFE vs. GFXD vs. MYSQLC (thin client only) 

-- creates vs. puts vs. updates vs. gets for each topology and API
   (requires modifying comparison keys)

Note that GFE and GFXD are non-transactional, while MYSQLC is read-uncommitted.
