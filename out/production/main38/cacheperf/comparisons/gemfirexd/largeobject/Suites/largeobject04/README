Transactional version of largeobject01.  All transactions do a single operation.

The suite can be used to compare:

-- transactional GFE vs. GFXD (all topologies)

-- transactional GFE vs. GFXD vs. MYSQLC (thin client only) 

-- non-transactional vs. transactional for GFE and GFXD
   (if a largeobject01 run is available)

-- transactional creates vs. puts vs. updates for each topology and API
   (requires modifying comparison keys)
