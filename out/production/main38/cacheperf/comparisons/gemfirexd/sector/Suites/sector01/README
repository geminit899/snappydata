Runs modestly scaled multihost Sector query tests with several topologies using GFXD, and using MYSQLC for thin clients only.  Partitioned tables use 1 redundant copy.  Runs with result size 3.

The suite can be used to compare:

-- peerClient vs. thinClient for GFXD

-- GFXD vs. MYSQLC (thin client only) 

Note that GFE and GFXD are non-transactional, while MYSQLC is read-uncommitted.

Note that tests that usually partition-by-column use partition-by-primary-key instead, unless they colocate, in which case the MYSQLC comparison is not a perfect match.
