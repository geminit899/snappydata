This suite runs the joinPruneByPositionAmountAndInstrumentName query on a single host (monster) and scales the result set sizes, client threads, and servers.

The suite can be used to compare GFXD peerClient to GFXD thinClient, and GFXD thinClient to MYSQL thinClient.

Changes the Sector data policy from REPLICATE to PARTITION.  Uses redundance when there is more than one server.

@todo Rerun with this changed back to REPLICATE, since it matters not to MYSQL.
