Modestly scaled query suite for GFXD using the Sector schema with no redundant copies for partitioned tables.  Runs with result size 1 and 3.

Used to compare one build/alpha/release to another.

Can also be used to compare peer and thin clients, but that is done elsewhere.

Note that GFE and GFXD are non-transactional, while MYSQLC is read-uncommitted.

This suite should be obsoleted once there are good regression numbers using sector01.
