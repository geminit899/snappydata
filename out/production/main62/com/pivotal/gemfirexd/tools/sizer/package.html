<p>
This package contains a tool which can be used to calculate the amount of
heap used by an object and all of the objects that are reachable from that
object. </p>

<p>
The ObjectSizer uses java.lang.instrument.Instrumentation to measure the size
of each individual object. It requires JDK 1.5 or greater, and the jar file
must be passed to java on the command line using java -javaagent:gemfirexd.jar.
See {@link com.pivotal.gemfirexd.tools.sizer.ObjectSizer} for details on how
to use the ObjectSizer class. </p>
