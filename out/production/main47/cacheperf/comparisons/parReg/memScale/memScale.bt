// How to turn the knobs on this test:
//   Controlling the number of entries per member
//      If maxKeys is N, then each member (designated with peerHosts/peerVMsPerHost)
//      will create N entries. The total for the PR will be maxKeys * num members.
//      For example, with maxKeys=100 and 2 members, each member creates 100 entries,
//      and the PR will have 200 entries.
