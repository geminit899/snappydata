Run one of the batterytest files:

	-- getInitialImage.bt
	-- getInitialImagePutsImpact.bt
	-- getInitialImageGetsImpact.bt

or configure your own test using any of the test configuration variables
illustrated in the .prop files and/or a local.conf.

To check whether the initial image is successful, the tests check the entry count.
For tests that also do gets, you can validate the correctness of the data with a
local.conf that includes:

    cacheperf.CachePerfPrms-validateObjects = true;
