                RUNNING THE MORGAN-STANLEY TESTS

= Configure a typical multi-host "local.conf" with the maximum number of
  hosts used in the test (currently 6).

= Run the "morgan.bt" batterytest file.

= Performance numbers are visible in both VSD and "perfreport.txt" except
  for the "addMember" test, which uses only "perfreport.txt".

= Tune the tests as desired.  For example, add multicast parameters to
  "local.conf" for selected tests.  When happy with results, add tuning
  parameters to the test configuration files.
