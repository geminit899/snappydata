// managed_1_Hosts is number of cache-servers in the system
// managed_2_Hosts is number of peers in the system
// edge_Hosts is number of gemfire clients
// locator_managing_Hosts is number of locator (also dedicated managers)
// managing_1_Hosts is number of managers (also dedicated managers)
// jmxIterations is number of times to iterate. One iteration roughly lasts 1 second

// No need to change other parameters

//Region Created : Tests creates following kind of regions in cacheserver, peers and clients
// Replicated, ReplicatedNoAck, Partition, Persistent Partition, ReplicatedPartition

// Registers 5 CQs per cacheserver
// 5 DLCOK services per managed vm
