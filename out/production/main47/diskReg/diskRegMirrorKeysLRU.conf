hydra.Prms-testDescription =
"This tests dataPolicy.replicate with any randomly 
selected distributed scope and disk regions. Disk for overflow is used. 
Note that persistent regions require dataPolicy = replicate.  
Overflow is by LRU.

Using the root region, this test has 1 thread that puts positive keys/values 
(keys with a positive Integer such as Object_8, value Long 8) and one thread 
that puts negative keys/values (keys with a negative Integer such as Object_9,
value Long 9). Other threads use hasKey and hasValueForKey to verify that
data distribution has occurred correctly. 

The end tasks verify that after shutting down all the regular task VMs, 
the correct objects and values appear in the region in the end tasks. The
end tasks concurrently do gets on all the objects created during the
regular tasks and verify their values.
