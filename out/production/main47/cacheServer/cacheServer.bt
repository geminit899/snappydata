// This test used to work because the CacheServer was a long running VM (not a bridgeServer)
// Now, it is always a server and now needs a unique port in its xml 
//    Add  <cache-server port="%CACHE_SERVER_PORT%" notify-by-subscription="false"/>
//    A new client cache xml with Pools, etc ... needs to be added (now that the application vms are edge clients)
