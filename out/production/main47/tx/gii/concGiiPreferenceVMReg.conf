Using vm regions, test the correctness of values that concurrently change during a getInitialImage,

This test creates a VM region, then does invalidates, localInvalidates,
destroys, localDestroys, adds new keys, updates existing keys all while
a getInitialImage is occurring. The entryOperations are done in a 
transactional context.  Values are checked for correctness after
the getInitialImage. The getInitalImage will obtain its entries by preferring 
a replicated cache over others.
