hydra.Prms-testDescription =
"This tests mirror KEYS_VALUES with any randomly selected distributed scope
and transactions.

Using the root region, this test has 1 thread that puts positive keys/values 
(keys with a positive Integer such as Object_8, value Long 8) and one thread 
that puts negative keys/values (keys with a negative Integer such as Object_9,
value Long 9). Other threads use hasKey and hasValueForKey to verify that
mirroring has occurred correctly.
