hydra.Prms-testDescription = "
Test in serial execution mode to carefully validate entry events.

The test uses one region, a distributed scope and replication of keys
and values. There is a listener, that increments a blackboard counter
for each event, installed in the region for each VM.

The test executes a task that creates/updates/invalidates/destroys
an object in a region, then waits for the listener counters to reach
the required number, indicating the event was received in a VM.

Each invocation of doEntryOperations performs a random selection of entry 
create/update/invalidate/destroy operations within a single transaction.
