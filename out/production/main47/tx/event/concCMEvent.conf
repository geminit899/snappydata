hydra.Prms-testDescription = "
This test concurrently executes ConcurrentMap operations (putIfAbsent, remove, replace) to create entry events. Also used: localInvalidate/localDestroy, entryTTL entryIdleTimeout, but no locks for running with high concurrency.  Each iteration of doEntryOperations() comprises a single transaction.  Conflicts may arise due to concurrent execution and are permitted by the test.  ";

// This concurrent event test does not support validation of event counters.
// This would not be possible in concurrent tx mode either as CommitConflict
// would prevent remote VMs from receiving updates.
