Test in serial execution mode to carefully validate region events.

The test uses a distributed scope and replication of keys
and values. There is a listener, that increments a blackboard counter
for each event, installed in the region for each VM.

The test executes a task that creates/invalidates/destroys
regions, then waits for the listener counters to reach
the required number, indicating the event was received in a VM.

This test executes region operations within a transactional context
