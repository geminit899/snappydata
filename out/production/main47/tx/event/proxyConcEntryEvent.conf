This test concurrently executes put/invalidate/destroy/get operations to
create entry events. Also used: localInvalidate/localDestroy, entryTTL
entryIdleTimeout, but no locks for running with high concurrency.
Each iteration of doEntryOperations() comprises a single transaction.
Conflicts may arise due to concurrent execution and are permitted by the test.

// This would not be possible in concurrent tx mode either as CommitConflict
