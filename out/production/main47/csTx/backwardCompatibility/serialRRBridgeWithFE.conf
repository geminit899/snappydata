hydra.Prms-testRequirement = "
Verify resumeable transaction behavior with function execution.  Edge clients use functions to execute: begin/suspend, resume/doOps/suspend and resume/commit(or rollback).";

hydra.Prms-testDescription = "
This test runs with multiple bridgeServers and edge clients.  Servers host a hierarchy of replicated regions.  Only the edgeClient threads execute functions in serial round robin scheduing. The first thread selects a key as a filter key, then executes a transaction (begin/suspend) on a server as determined by the filterSet (key).  All remaining threads then execute a function to resume the transaction and execute operations before suspending and returning the OpList back to the calling edge client.  (EdgeClients maintain a list of expected values on the BB based on the opList returned by the function for use in validation).  The first thread then executes a function (rollback/commit) and then executes a function to verify the servers cache contents based on the snapshot map maintained on the BB";
