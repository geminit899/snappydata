hydra.Prms-testRequirement = "
Test that conflicts occur/don't occur with entry and region operations, 
and with a mixture of threads running in and outside transactions";

hydra.Prms-testDescription = "
This test runs with 2 threads only in serial round robin scheduing. The first 
thread does random operations (always in a transaction), and the 2nd thread 
then randomly chooses to run in or outside a transaction and does operations 
that will/will not conflict with the first thread. The first thread tries to 
commits first; it may or may not fail depending on what the 2nd thread did. 
Then the second thread tries to commit; it may or may not fail, if in a 
transaction, depending on what the 1st thread did.
