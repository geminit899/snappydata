hydra.Prms-testRequirement = "
Test conflicts that occur because of reads noting the committed
state (see bug 36688), and checks that repeatable reads return 
the correct value";

hydra.Prms-testDescription = "
This test runs with any two threads in any one or two VMs. 
   First round:
      The first thread in the round does a begin
      The other thread in the round does a begin and either a repeatable read
          or a nonrepeatable read.
   Second round:
      The first thread does ops and commites (expects a successful commit).
      The other thread does ops that either conflict or not and will
          attempt a commit, expecting either success or failure 
          depending on whether the ops created a conflict or not.
