hydra.Prms-testRequirement = "
Verify resumeable transaction behavior with function execution.  PR accessors use functions to execute: begin/suspend, resume/doOps/suspend and resume/commit(or rollback).";

hydra.Prms-testDescription = "
This test runs with bridgeServer dataStores and edge clients as accessors.  Servers host colocated Persistent PartitionRegions; a PartitionResolver is also configured for the regions.  Edge clients execute concurrent resumable transactions.  The test dynamically determines whether to begin, executeTxOps or commit transactions (maintained in a list of activeTxns on the BB) based on the number of open transactions and the number of times ExecuteTx function has been invoked on each.";
