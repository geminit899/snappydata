Ensure that threads waiting in tryResume(with wait) exit immediately when the transaction is committed";

hydra.Prms-testDescription = "
This test runs with multiple bridgeServers (hosting a PR) and edgeClients.  One edge client thread runs a TXController.  This TXController executes an entire transaction (begin, execute tx ops and commit) without ever suspending the transaction.  Meanwhile, the remaining accessor threads enter tryResume with a wait.  The test verifies that the threads in tryResume return immediately (actually before the commit completes) rather than staying in the tryResume for the given wait time";
