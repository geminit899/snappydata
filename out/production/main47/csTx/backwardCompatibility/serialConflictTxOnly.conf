hydra.Prms-testRequirement = "
Test that conflicts occur/don't occur using only transactional operations
and always running inside a transaction.";

hydra.Prms-testDescription = "
This test runs with any number of threads in any number of VMs. The 1st
thread does random transactional operations (in a transaction), then each
of the subsequent threads in the round begin a transaction and do operations
that either intentionally conflict or not conflict with any thread that did
operations before it. On the second round, each thread tries to commit; the
1st thread aways succeeds (because it commits first), and all other threads
then either succeed or fail depending on what operations they did.
