In a client VM/bridge server configuration, one client VM loads data into the
region, which distributes it to all bridge servers. Then the same VM does
operation on the region (destroy, invalidate, etc). Each remaining client 
VM then calls registerInterest, either with interest policy KEYS, KEYS_VALUES
or NONE with ALL_KEYS as the keys of interest, then validates that the proper keys
and/or values are present in the client region.";
