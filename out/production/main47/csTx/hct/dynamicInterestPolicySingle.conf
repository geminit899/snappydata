In a client VM/bridge server configuration, one client VM loads data into the
region, which distributes it to all bridge servers. Then the same VM does
operation on the region (destroy, invalidate, etc) while each remaining client 
VM calls registerInterest repeatedly with a single key, either with interest 
policy KEYS, KEYS_VALUES or NONE, then validates that the proper keys
and/or values are present in the client region.";
