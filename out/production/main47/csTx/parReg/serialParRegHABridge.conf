hydra.Prms-testDescription = "
This test executes operations on entries on a PartitionedRegion and carefully
validates for correctness. The data store for the partitioned region is spread
across all VMs. The test uses serial round robin; the first thread
in the round does a random operation, then all other threads in the round
verify their view of the operation. After the last thread in the round verifies,
it then becomes the first in the next round, thus the thread doing the random
operation changes for each round.
