Finished run. Collating benchmark totals now.

Benchmark results:

	Total Time = [\d]+\.[\d]+ seconds
	Total Puts = 300 put operations
	Total Samples = 60 benchmark samples
	Total Kilobytes = 300 kilobytes

	Average Puts Per Second = [\d]+\.[\d]+ puts
	Average Kilobytes Per Second = [\d]+\.[\d]+ kilobytes of data
	Average Operations Time = [\d]+\..* nanoseconds per put
	Average Byte Time = [\d]+\..* milliseconds per byte of data

	Best Puts Per Second = ([\d]+\.[\d]+|Infinity) puts
	Best Kilobytes Per Second = ([\d]+\.[\d]+|Infinity) kilobytes of data
	Best Operations Time = ([\d]+\..*|Infinity) nanoseconds per put
	Best Byte Time = ([\d]+\..*|Infinity) milliseconds per byte of data
	Note: Best sample is representative of performance after JVM warms up.
