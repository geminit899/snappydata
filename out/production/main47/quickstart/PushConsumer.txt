This example shows how a distributed region works with replication enabled. I'll create a replicate region, then the producer will create the same region and put entries into it. Because my region is a replicate, all of the producer's puts are automatically pushed into my region. 

Connecting to the distributed system and creating the cache.
Example region, /exampleRegion, created in cache. 

Please start the PushProducer.
