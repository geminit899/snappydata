This example uses disk to extend a region's capacity. The region is
configured with an eviction controller that overflows data to disk when
the region reaches a specified capacity.

Connecting to the distributed system and creating the cache.

Example region "/exampleRegion" created in cache. 

Putting 250 cache entries of 10 kilobytes each into the cache.
When the configured limit of 1 megabyte capacity is reached, the data
will overflow to files in overflowData1. Note the number of
overflow files created.

Finished putting entries.

Use another shell to see the overflow files in overflowData1.
The disk is used to extend available memory and these files are
treated as part of the local cache.

Press Enter in this shell to continue.

Destroying some entries to allow compaction of overflow files...

Please look again in overflowData1. The data in overflow files is
compacted and the two files are merged into one.

Press Enter in this shell to continue.

Closing the cache and disconnecting.
