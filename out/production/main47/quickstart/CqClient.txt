Connecting to the distributed system and creating the cache...
Example region "/exampleRegion" created in cache.
Creating CQ "MyCq" with query
"SELECT \* FROM /exampleRegion e where e='ClientFirstValue'"
Executing CQ "MyCq"...
This client will update the server cache and its CQ listener will
get events for any changes to the CQ result set.
CQ events provide the base operation \(the change to the server's cache\),
and the query operation \(the change to the CQ's result set\).
Press Enter to continue.

CQ looking for entries whose value is 'ClientFirstValue'...
Putting key1 with value 'ClientFirstValue'
This satisfies the query, so the CqListener will report a query
creation event from the server cache.

     CqListener:
    Received cq event for entry: key1, ClientFirstValue
    With BaseOperation = Create and QueryOperation = Create
Press Enter to continue.

CQ looking for entries whose value is 'ClientFirstValue'...
Updating key1 with value 'ClientSecondValue'
This removes key1 from the CQ result set, to the CQListener will
report a query destroy event.

     CqListener:
    Received cq event for entry: key1, ClientSecondValue
    With BaseOperation = Update and QueryOperation = Destroy
Press Enter to continue.

Updating key1 with value 'ClientFirstValue'
This adds key1 back into the CQ result set, to the CQListener will
report a query create event.

     CqListener:
    Received cq event for entry: key1, ClientFirstValue
    With BaseOperation = Update and QueryOperation = Create

Destroying key1...
This removes key1 from the result set, to the CQListener will
report a query destroy event.

     CqListener:
    Received cq event for entry: key1, 
    With BaseOperation = Destroy and QueryOperation = Destroy
Press Enter to continue.
Closing the cache and disconnecting.
Please stop the cacheserver with 'gfsh stop server --dir=server_cq'.
