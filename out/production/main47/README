                               TABLE OF CONTENTS
================================================================================

All top-level directories in the test tree are described here, including the
principal owner(s).  Tests owned by all of QA give "qa" as the owner, developers
as "dev", and business development as "bizdev".

All tests are hydra-based unless otherwise noted.

Some directories listed here have not yet been ported forward from 2.0.2, and
are noted as such.
