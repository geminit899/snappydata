TOPOLOGIES
peer (just a few)
empty peer to peer
empty client to server
empty peer to server to empty client
empty client to server to empty peer listener (just a few)

OPERATIONS
create
get
put
update (just a few)

DATA POLICIES
replicate
partition
persistentReplicate (run awhile longer)
persistentPartition (run awhile longer)

FEATURES

MISC
thinClientScalability?

NEED SMOKEPERF
custom partitioning (new tests)
function execution (based on existing scaled tests)
persistence, partition (based on existing smokeperf)
pr listeners (new tests)
recovery, disk (based on existing scaled tests)
recovery, bucket (based on existing scaled tests)

SKIP (some coverage in smokeperf)
connection
delta propagation, cloning
dlock
eviction using entry/mem lru and/or local destroy
expiration
loaders
mixed operations
multicast
scope noack, local, global
security
thin client
very small or large objects
wan
wbcl
Solaris, Windows

NOT COVERED 
custom partitioning
gii (except recovery as noted above)
ha (except recovery as noted above)
native client (in progress for smokeperf?)
gfxd (will be covered separately)

LIMITATIONS
tests alternate conserveSockets true/false
tests alternate objects 1K byte[] vs. 1K DataSerializable
client/server tests alternate selector or not
client/server tests alternate thread local connections or not
client/server tests use pools with bridge servers not server locators
all accessors (peers, clients) are empty
all tests use scope dack for peers, local for clients
all tests with partitioning use redundancy 1
all tests use the default setting for pr single hop (enabled)
all partition tests use 10 buckets per datahost
all partition tests preassign buckets
all tests use Long keys
all tests run 32-bit JDK 1.6
all tests use optimized gc
all tests use the hs21 Linux hosts at the data center
all tests use from 4 to 8 hosts (plus one for master)
all tests use multiple operating threads per VM
all tests use moderate amounts of data (1 million objects or so)
total run time is 24 hours or less

If needed, cut 002 and 010 since they are all local gets.
Add eviction tests for more topologies.
