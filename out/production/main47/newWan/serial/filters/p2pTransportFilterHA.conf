 Each sender from a site connects to all other remote sites to form all-to-all topology. Peers does random operation and HA of other peers.
 Transport filter is applied at at sender which modify ValueHolder.extraObject and add applied transport filter info. The transport filter at receiver revert ValueHolder.extraObject. 
 At the end validate that all site has consistent data and no entry has transport filter information available.";
