hydra.Prms-testDescription="WAN test where each cache server is a bridge for the edge clients at its site and is a WAN gateway sender and receiver to other cache servers.
 Each locator from a site connects to all locators from next site to form a ring topology between sites. 
 Each sender from a site connects to all other remote sites to form all-to-all topology. Peers does random operation and HA of other peers. 
 Event filter is applied at all sender which filters out some keys. Validation check that filtered keys are present only in originating site
 and not present is other sites. Then each site removes their filter keys so that at the end all site has consistent data. 
 MyTransportFilter1, MyTransportFilter2 are applied at at sender which modify ValueHolder.extraObject that transport filter is applied. 
 The MyTransportFilter2, MyTransportFilter1 filters at receiver reverts ValueHolder.extraObject to its original state.
 At the end validate that no entry has transport filter applied.";
