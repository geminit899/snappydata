// WAN Site #1 is spread across two hosts, divided into wan1Lose and wan2Survive clients
// The network partition divides the peers in WAN Site #1 as per the SplitBrainTestSpec, Section 10.3.5.2
// New with quorum partitioning, we will still see host2 as the surviving side
// host1 has a weight of 20 (2 servers)
// host2 has a weight of 28 (2 servers (1 is the lead member), 1 locator)
// WAN Site #1, Host 1: has 2 peer client VMs  (wan1Lose: EC)
//                    : admin (to monitor SystemMembershipListener and AlertListener events)
// WAN Site #1, Host 2: has 2 more peer client VMs and 1 locators (wan1Survive: Coordinator, LM)
//                    : admin (to monitor SystemMembershipListener and AlertListener events)
// WAN Site #2, Host 2: has 4 peer client VMs and 2 locators  (wan2)
//
// locator naming scheme: locator_<wanSite(1 or 2)>_<host(1 or 2)>
