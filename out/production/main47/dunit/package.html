<P>This package contains the building blocks for GemFire Distributed
Unit Tests.  DUnit is based on JUnit, but has support for invoking
methods in VMs running on remote machines.  A typical DUnit test class
is a subclass of {@link dunit.DistributedTestCase} whose
<code>setUp</code> method creates a new GemFire connection in each
remote VM and whose <code>tearDown</code> method closes that
connection.  (Note that there is also the {@link
com.gemstone.gemfire.internal.cache.DistributedCacheTestCase} that
contains convient methods for accessing distributed caches.)  There is
special hydra machinery ({@link hydra.JUnitTestTask}) that will create
a {@link junit.framework.TestSuite} from each test case class and run
it, sending the output to various log files.</P>

<P>A DUnit test uses the {@link dunit.VM#invoke(java.lang.Class,
java.lang.String) invoke} methods to execute methods in a remote VM.
(Note that methods whose names begin with "remote" are informally
assumed to be executed in a remote VM.)  The usual JUnit assert
methods are available.  When an exception occurs during a remote
method invocation, an {@link dunit.RMIException} is thrown.  If
caught, the test can examine the exception that was thrown.
Additionally, the {@link dunit.VM#invokeAsync(java.lang.Class,
java.lang.String) invokeAsync} methods can be used to execute multiple
remote methods asynchronously.</P>

<PRE>
package dunit.tests;

import com.gemstone.gemfire.distributed.*;
import dunit.*;

public class BasicTest extends DistributedTestCase {
  public void testRegionPutGet() {
    final Host host = Host.getHost(0);
    VM vm0 = host.getVM(0);
    VM vm1 = host.getVM(1);
    final String name = this.getUniqueName();
    final Object value = new Integer(42);
 
    vm0.invoke(this.getClass(), "put", new Object[] {name,value});
    vm1.invoke(this.getClass(), "get", new Object[] {name,value});
  }
  private static void put(String name, Object value) {
    ...// get the region //...
    region.put(name, value);
  }
  private static void get(String name, Object value) {
    ...// get the region //...
    assertEquals(value, region.get(name));
  }
}

<P>Because they rely on Hydra to manage VMs and GemFire systems, DUnit
tests must be run in the context of a Hydra test.  If you want to run
an individual tests, you can use a Hydra config file such as the one
below.  Note that the config file should only contain a
<TT>UNITTEST</TT> task and no <TT>STARTTASK</TT>s or
<TT>ENDTASK</TT>s.  To ensure that multiple developers running
Distributed Unit Tests do not interfere with each other, the
<code>dunit.inc</code> file specifies that all VMs and GemFire systems
run on localhost.</P>

<PRE>
// This config file is used to run Distributed Unit Tests
INCLUDE $JTESTS/dunit/impl/dunit.inc;

UNITTEST
    testClass = com.gemstone.gemfire.internal.cache.GlobalRegionTest
    testMethod = testPut
    testMethod = testGet

    # Runs all test* methods in OwnershipTest
    testClass = com.gemstone.gemfire.internal.cache.OwnershipTest
    ;
</PRE>

<P>You can then invoke Hydra with the below command line.  Note
that your CLASSPATH environment variable must be set to include the
test classes.</P>

<PRE>
$ java -DGEMFIRE=$PRODUCT -Dgemfire.home=$PRODUCT -DJTESTS=$JTESTS \
  -DconfigFileName=myDunitTests.conf hydra.MasterController
</PRE>

<P>The test will start up several VMs and GemFire systems (as
specified in <code>dunit.inc</code>) and will run the unit tests.  The
progress of the tests, as well as information about failures and
warnings, is written to a file named <code>dunit.txt</code> in the
directory in which the test is run.  Additional information (including
standard out and standard err) can be found in Hydra's master and
client log files.</P>

<P>Executing DUnit tests are also part of the standard GemFire build
process.  A special Ant task ({@link dunit.impl.DUnitConfigAntTask})
creates a Hydra configuration file (from an Ant file set containing
the names test classes) which is used by the Distributed Unit Test
smoke test.</P>
