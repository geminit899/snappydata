This package contains unit tests and performance tests for GemFire's
low-level distribution framework.  Many of the unit tests use the
{@link dunit} testing framework and are run as part of a standard
build.  Other tests (such as {@link
com.gemstone.gemfire.distributed.internal.DistributionChannelPerf})
are performance tests that require multiple machines.  They use
special hydra configuration files and are not run as part of the
build.
