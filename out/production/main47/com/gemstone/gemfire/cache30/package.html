<P>Contains unit tests that form a "compatibility test suite" of sorts
for the GemFire 3.0 distributed caching API.  It was developed using a
"clean room" technique in which someone other than the cache API
implementation wrote the unit tests.  These tests are intended to find
bugs in both the implementation and the documentation of the cache
API.</P>

<P>In hopes of keeping the tests organized, there is a hierarchy of
<code>abstract</code> TestCase classes.  Each class in the hierarchy
contains tests for a certain class ({@link
com.gemstone.gemfire.cache30.RegionTestCase}, for example) or group of
classes ({@link
com.gemstone.gemfire.cache30.RegionAttributesTestCase}, for
example).</P>

<HR>

<P>Below are descriptions of functionality and scenarios that need to
be tested by unit tests.</P>

<OL>

<LI>Create a distributed region with DISTRIBUTED-ACK scope and local

one of the other 2 VMs. Verify that netSearch returns the value if
there is at least one system that can serve up the request.</LI>

  <UL>
  <LI>Note: The DUnit framework isn't well-suited for "killing off"
  VMs.  This functionality may have to be tested using a standard
  hydra test.</LI>

there is at least one system that can serve the request within the
timeout period.</LI>
