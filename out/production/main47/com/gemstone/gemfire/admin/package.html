<P>Contains {@linkplain dunit DUnit} tests that exercise the external
{@link com.gemstone.gemfire.admin admin} API.  The classes in this
package are designed so that they may extended to test multiple
administraion configurations.  The root test class is {@link
AdminDUnitTestCase} whose subclasses test the admin API.  All
administration performed by these tests are VM-local.  These tests are
also extends by classes in the {@link com.gemstone.gemfire.admin.jmx}
package that test administation via JMX.  That package also contains
an implementation of the admin interface API that is backed by JMX
{@link javax.management.ObjectName}s allowing for remote
administration.  The below diagram depicts the relationship of the
admin DUnit tests.  The most important thing to note is that test
methods are all defined once in the superclass and are inherited by
all of the subclasses.</P>
