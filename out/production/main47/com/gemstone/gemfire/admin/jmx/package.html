<P>Contains tests for administering GemFire via JMX.  It also contains
classes that provide an implementation of the external {@link
com.gemstone.gemfire.admin admin} API that uses JMX to do all of the
admin work, the JMX "facade".  This allows us test both the external
admin API and JMX acceess using the same test code.</P>
