wanPerf.bt and concurrencyLevelPerf.bt are based on existing smoketest/perf tests for WAN Gateways.

In order to run these on multiple hosts, I have created separate copies here.
Each runs the same set of tests: wanPerf.bt runs with concurrencyLevel = 0.
concurrencyLevelPerf.bt runs with a varying concurrencyLevel.

Modify the corresponding local.confs (local.wanPerf.conf and local.concurrencyLevelPerf.conf) for your hostnames.  In addition, you may want to modify and uncomment these lines in the local.conf.

// Avoid negative latency (when clocks are off)
//hydra.timeserver.TimeServerPrms-clockSkewUpdateFrequencyMs = 1000;

// log directly on remote hosts vs. incurring cost of logging across the network
//hydra.HostPrms-resourceDirBaseMapFileName = /home/lhughes/bin/hosts/hostmap.prop;
