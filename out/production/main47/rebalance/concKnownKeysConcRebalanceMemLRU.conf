hydra.Prms-testDescription = "This test creates a partitioned region with a MemLRU (overflowToDisk). It then executes various entry operations on a known key range while rebalance is in progress. Values are checked for correctness in the close task.  The rebalancing VM is initialized after the data is loaded (without recovery), to give the rebalanceTask work to do during the TASK phase.  Rebalance is executed while ops are in progress.  Another rebalance is done as the first CLOSETASK";
