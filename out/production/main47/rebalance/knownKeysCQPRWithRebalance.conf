hydra.Prms-testDescription = "This test extends cq/knownKeysCQPR.conf by adding rebalancing.  This test creates random CQs, loads a set of keys, does known operations to 
key intervals, then validates the CQs and initialResultSet using a partitioned region.
During the TASK phase, rebalance is also run concurrently.  Data sizes vary in order
to create imbalance during doOps().  In addition, the rebalancing VM is initialized after the data is loaded (without recovery) to create work for the rebalance.
