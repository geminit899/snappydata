hydra.Prms-testDescription = "
There are 2 vms in this test, and they step back and forth. Only one vm has initialized
with a region, the other has not created a cache or region.
   1) VM A does ops while starting VM B. VM B creates the cache and disk regions, but 
      it will not do ops; it will get its values from a gii of VM A. After VM B completes 
      its initialization, VM A finishes ops, writes the regions' state to the blackboard 
      and stops itself. Now VM B has the latest disk files.
   2) VM B, which initialized from gii had to update its disk files while
      ops occurred in VM A. To verify that VM B's disk files are good, VM B stops, restarts
      and verifies against the blackboard.
   Now VM B does step 1 (becoming VM A in the description above) and VM A becomes VM B.
