To run this example manually start the example application. You will be 
prompted for stock symbols to enter. The example is case sensitive, so 
symbols are expected to be in uppercase. Try a few such as SUNW, IBM, 
COLM, UNTD. When finished entering symbols, enter a return at the prompt 
to gracefuly exit the example. This command starts the example.
