All examples should be run manually on all platforms. We want to run
these manually, even though we have automated tests for them, because
manually is how customers will run them.  Instructions for running tests 
manually are in:
   dist/howtorun.txt (for the flashcache example)
   dist/cacheOverflow/howtorun.txt (for cache overflow examples)
    


To run the examples automatically, run the following battery test file.
Some of these tests do not run on windows. It is OK, however, to run 
this .bt file on windows, as hydra will automatically skip over the
tests in this .bt file that are unable to run on windows. However, 
hydra will run all tests in this .bt file on Solaris and Linux.
   Run tests in tests/examples/examples.bt
