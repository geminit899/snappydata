//
// VOLUME TESTING
//
// Scaled up 64-bit functional tests with large heaps and lots of data.
//
// Run these tests on sufficient 64-bit hosts with a minimum of 8 GB RAM to
// avoid swapping.  Run BatteryTest with -DmasterHeapMB=3000 to support larger
// blackboards.  Also run with -DmoveRemoteDirs=true and with system directories
// local to each VM to accommodate overflow.
//
// To collect more complete logs, set hydra.log.LogPrms-file_maxKBPerVM to a
// very large value.  It is currently set to 25000 KB in all tests.
