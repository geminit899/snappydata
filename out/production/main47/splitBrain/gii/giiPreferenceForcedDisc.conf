This test creates a VM region, then does invalidates, localInvalidates,
destroys, localDestroys, adds new keys, updates existing keys all while
a getInitialImage is occurring. Values are checked for correctness after
the getInitialImage. The getInitalImage will obtain its entries by preferring 
a replicated cache over others.
