Host2 contains the Coordinator and the LeadMember (BridgeServer).  Edge Clients are performing entry operations.  Once the partition occurs, the members on host2 should continue without interruption.  Host1 VMs should shutdown and disconnect from the DS.  Clients connected to servers in Partition1 should failover to Servers in Partition2";
