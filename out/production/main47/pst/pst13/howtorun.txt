Use a local.conf (example in this dir) to specify 30 machines to act as hosts (Solaris 
and/or Linux). Reserve as many machines as possible, making up the difference by asking 
to use individual's machines.  The test runs for almost one hour so lunchtime is a good 
time to run the test.  This is a PST test so exclusive use is required.

Run the batterytest file pst13_gemfire.bt with local.conf file indicating
the hosts and the base directories you want to use for system logs and archives.  

The machine on which pst13_gemfire.bt runs is the "Master" host.  The "Master" host 
must have file system and ssh access to all the machines in the test.  In addition
all machines in the test must be able to access the file system on the "Master". If
file system access is a problem, refresh automount tables using "super automount".

Remember to use:
1. correct GemFire version and 
2. correct snapshot location 
in all appropriate places in local.conf.
