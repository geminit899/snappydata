How To Analyze PST13 (maximum nodes)
====================================

Test Description:
Cache get/put performance for a GemFire cache using scope distributed ack, a vm region, and objects 
of type objects.ArrayOfByte and size 1K.  There are 10 threads per VM on 30 VMs on 30 hosts.  Threads 
do 80% gets and 20% puts, using random keys.  A capacity controller ensures that some gets are cache misses.

This test is run on 30 hosts in the development network (a mixture of linux & solaris).  The local.conf file
lists all the machines involved in the test.

For 3.0, the following results were reported:
300 threads on 30 hosts (mixed linux and solaris):
    1562 gets/sec total throughput
     387 puts/sec total throughput

There was an error during the ENDTASK, so results were gathered from the 
VSD stats.

getsPerSecond
=============
From one of the cacheperf.CachePerfStats Thread-XXX, select the gets stat.  Then right click in the top upper 
window and choose Select > by Statistic.  (Note that combine and combine across files are set from the 'Main'
drop down list).  Trim the warm up & cooldown (where we aren't doing any gets).  Use the mean value.

putsPerSecond
=============
From one of the cacheperf.CachePerfStats Thread-XXX, select the puts stat.  Then right click in the top upper 
window and choose Select > by Statistic.  (Note that combine and combine across files are set from the 'Main'
drop down list).  Trim the warm up & cooldown (where we aren't doing any puts).  Use the mean value.
