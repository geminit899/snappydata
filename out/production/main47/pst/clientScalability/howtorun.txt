*******************************************************************************
Use a local.conf (example with 30 hoste in this dir) to specify N machines to act as hosts (fast hosts only) for 128 nodes.
There are 2 tests each running 30 minutes + start/stop time.  

Run the batterytest file scaleClient.bt with local.conf file indicating
the hosts and the base directories you want to use for system logs and archives.  

The machine on which scaleClient.bt runs is the "Master" host.  The "Master" host 
must have file system and ssh access to all the machines in the test.  In addition
all machines in the test must be able to access the file system on the "Master". If
file system access is a problem, refresh automount tables using "super automount".

Remember to use:
1. correct GemFire version and 
2. correct snapshot location 
in all appropriate places in local.conf.
