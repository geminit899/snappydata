Cache Bridge Loader tests

cacheLoader/hc/hc.bt includes the basic list of tests to run.

Make sure Oracle is up and running, and that data has been preloaded.
If necessary, modify config values from cacheLoader/hc/dbparms.inc.
To preload the Oracle DB, run reloadRDB.conf. 

These tests expect oracle to be running on orahost.  If oracle isn't
running,  follow the instructions below:

1. login to orahost as user oracle
2. execute:

   % dbstart
   % lsnrctl start

For additional information about oracle, including oracle users and passwords, you can look at /home/stever/checkouts/gss64bit_11x/tests/connecttst/aaareadme.txt.

You can check out this file from CVS if you want your own copy:

cvs checkout -d oracleinfo gss64bit/tests/connecttst/aaareadme.txt

Also, you can reference /home/users/oracle/.rdbmsrc for $ORACLE_HOME and $ORACLE_SID settings on the various hosts where oracle is installed.

Run the hc.bt file to exercise all test variations:
- getTimeout* tests try to read data, but always time out.
- other get* tests read data, never timing out.  They use a variety of
  capacity controllers.
- mix* tests read data, occasionally timing out.  They use a variety of
  capacity controllers.

By default, these tests us 2 edge clients and 3 cache servers.
It is best to run each set on a different host.  To do so, add 
something like the following to your local.conf:

  hydra.HostPrms-names = // bridges on host "pope" and edges on host "biker"
      fcn "hydra.TestConfigFcns.pool(\"pope\",  ${bridgeHosts})" ncf
      fcn "hydra.TestConfigFcns.pool(\"biker\", ${edgeHosts})"   ncf;

To run on one low-powered box, such as a standard windows desktop,
run a modified hc.bt file using these sizing properties for each test:

  bridgeHosts = 1 bridgeVMsPerHost = 1 bridgeThreadsPerVM = 1
  edgeHosts   = 1 edgeVMsPerHost   = 1 edgeThreadsPerVM   = 3

Most tests run for about 15 minutes (totalTaskTimeSec = 600).
getTimeout* tests have a totalTaskTimeSec of 60 seconds.
