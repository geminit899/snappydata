//==============================================================================

// GRID SCHEDULER
//==============================================================================

Goal: Run a set of batterytests in minimal time in the easiest possible way.
-- provide a list of tests, local.confs, hosts, and host-filesystem map
-- schedule a test per host, keeping all hosts busy
-- allow hosts to be dynamically added and removed from the host list
-- handle multi-host tests: reserve required hardware as it becomes available
-- allow different local.conf files for individual tests or batterytest suites
-- allow test files to be forced onto one host
-- keep a master oneliner.txt containing .bt file, test path, and result path
-- organize results on each host to minimize clutter
-- integrate with regression result reporting
-- integrate with runBT.sh

Implementation notes:
-- keep a queue per host, usually empty unless reserved for multihost test or
   test subset must run on same host
-- read available host list at each scheduling to pick up dynamic changes
-- create grid test config object that includes parent .bt file and local.conf

-- grepForErrors
-- support rerunning failed tests
-- support rerunning successful tests
-- complain about unused properties?
