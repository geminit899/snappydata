====== USAGE ====================================================================

Prepare a batterytest configuration file following the syntax and
grammar described later in this file.

Before running a batterytest using your file, test it by setting up your
environment as you would for a test run (see batterytest/BatteryTest.java).

Then execute:

  java -classpath $JTESTS:$GEMFIRE/lib/gemfire.jar \
       -DGEMFIRE=$GEMFIRE                          \
       -DJTESTS=$JTESTS                          \
       -DtestFileName=<filename>
        batterytest.ConfigParser <filename>

See gemfire/tests/batterytest/parse for an example.

Examine the result to make sure you are getting the settings you expect.
