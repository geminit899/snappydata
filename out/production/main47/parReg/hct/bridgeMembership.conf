hydra.Prms-testDescription = "Extension of hct/bridgeMembership.conf - periodically chooses and kills a bridge server to test failover while tracking counts of kill/shutdown and validates that appropriate number of BridgeMembership (memberCrashed, memberDeparted and memberJoined) events are seen.  Servers are participating in a partitionedRegion.  In addition, client VMs are disconnected & re-connected to the DistributedSystem (memberJoined events) and in CLOSETASKS all clientVMs are killed (memberCrashed events).  Bridge loaders use the sticky load-balancing policy";
