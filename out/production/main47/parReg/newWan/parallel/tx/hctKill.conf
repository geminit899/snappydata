hydra.Prms-testDescription="WAN test where each cache server is a bridge for the edge clients at its site and is a WAN gateway sender and receiver to other cache servers.
 Each locator from a site connects to all locators from next site to form a ring topology between sites.
 Each sender from a site connects to all other remote sites to form all-to-all topology. A peer dynamically stops other peers from same site,
 does entry operations with transaction enabled and then restart the stopped vms. Test creates partitioned region with parallel gateway senders.";
