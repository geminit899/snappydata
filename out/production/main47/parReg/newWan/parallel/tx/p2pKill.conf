hydra.Prms-testDescription="WAN test where each site is peer-to-peer in its own distributed system and each peer VM
 is a gateway sender and gateway receiver to other sites. Each locator from a site connects to all locators from next site to form a ring topology between sites.
 Each sender from a site connects to all other remote sites to form all-to-all topology. A peer dynamically stops other peers from same site,
 does entry operations with transaction enabled and then restart the stopped vms. Test creates partitioned region with parallel gateway senders.";
