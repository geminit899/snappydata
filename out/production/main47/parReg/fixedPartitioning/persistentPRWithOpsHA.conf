hydra.Prms-testDescription = "This test is for testing Fixed Partitioning (With Persistence) of Partitioned Region in peer to peer configuration with HA (fail over).
This test create the FPRs programmatically.
The test uses XML to re-create cache and region during the reinitialization (HA) scenario.
Fixed partition resolver is set as partition attribute.
The test uses accessors (which have localMaxMemory 0 and no Fixed Partition Attributes (FPA) set), also datastore with FPAs set.
FPAs have different partition num buckets for different partitions but there is maximum one primary partition per member.
The test uses region operations and operations using function execution with HA. Test also uses random onRegion function executions - with/without filter, args, result collector with HA.
The test verifies the number of primaries of buckets, data consistency across buckets, ops validations, primary & secondary Fixed Partitioning and partition-num-buckets.
The test also verifies that the rebalancing operation does not affect Fixed partitioning.
The number of datastores that get recycled at a time is from 1 to redundantCopies mentioned.";
