hydra.Prms-testDescription = "In this serial round-robin test, one thread starts a transaction and does multiple operations on colocated entries in partitionedRegions.  The test verifies that the cacheWriter is verified inline with the operations.  In addition, each VM verifies it's view of the data for the affected entries with the txThread verifying it sees the TxState and the other threads verifying that those changes are not visible until commit time.  Cache and TxListeners are also invoked and the contents of those events validated.  This test verifies -Dgemfire.BucketRegion.alwaysFireLocalListener behavior";
