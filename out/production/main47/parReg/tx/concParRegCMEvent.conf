Test in serial execution mode to carefully validate entry events.

The test uses one region, a distributed scope and dataPolicy = partitioned.
There is a listener, that increments a blackboard counter for each event, installed in the region for each VM.

The test executes a task that executes entry and concurrentMap operations transactionally to modify an object in a region, then waits for the listener counters to reach the required number, indicating the event was received in a VM.
