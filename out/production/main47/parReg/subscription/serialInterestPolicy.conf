hydra.Prms-testDescription = "
This test executes operations on entries on a client and carefully
validates remote clients for correctness when registerInterest is
called. The test uses serial round robin; the first thread
in the round does a random operation, then all other threads in the round
call registerInterest and verify their view of the region. After the last 
thread in the round verifies, it then becomes the first in the next round, 
thus the thread doing the random operation changes for each round.
