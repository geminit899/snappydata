hydra.Prms-testDescription = "
In a client VM/bridge server configuration, one client VM loads data into the
region, which distributes it to all bridge servers. Then the same VM does
operation on the region (destroy, invalidate, etc). Each remaining client 
VM then calls registerInterest, either with interest policy KEYS, KEYS_VALUES
or NONE with a list of keys of interest. The keys of interest are only a partial
list of all the keys created in the load step. Then we validate that the proper keys
and/or values are present in the client region.";
