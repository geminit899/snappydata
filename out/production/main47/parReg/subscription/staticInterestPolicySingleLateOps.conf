In a client VM/bridge server configuration, one client VM loads data into the
region, which distributes it to all bridge servers. Each remaining client 
VM then calls registerInterest, either with interest policy KEYS, KEYS_VALUES
or NONE with ALL_KEYS as the keys of interest. Then the same VM that did the
load does operations on the region (destroy, invalidate, etc). Each remaining 
client then validates that the proper keys and/or values are present in the 
client region.";
