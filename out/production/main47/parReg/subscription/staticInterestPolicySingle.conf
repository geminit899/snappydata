In a client VM/bridge server configuration, one client VM loads data into the
region, which distributes it to all bridge servers. Then the same VM does
operation on the region (destroy, invalidate, etc). Each remaining client 
VM then calls registerInterest repeatedly, either with interest policy KEYS, 
KEYS_VALUES or NONE with a single of key of interest, then validates that the 
proper keys and/or values are present in the client region.";
