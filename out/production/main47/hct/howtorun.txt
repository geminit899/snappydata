These tests use up to 6 GemFire systems. To specify the hosts
used in the test, add the parameters below to your local.conf file.
Each host name maps to a GemFire system.

   hydra.HostPrms-hostNames = spiroc stealth bilbo pope pope pope;

The following parameters are OPTIONAL, used when doing multi-platform 
testing with sanctioned builds.  The directory under spiroc1 is a
Solaris snapshot; the one under bilbo1 is a linux snapshot.

   hydra.HostPrms-gemfireHomes =
     /spiroc1/users/belindaf/gemfire.119/product
     /spiroc1/users/belindaf/gemfire.119/product
     /bilbo1/users/belindaf/gemfire.119/product
     /spiroc1/users/belindaf/gemfire.119/product
   ;
   hydra.HostPrms-javaHomes =
     /spiroc1/users/belindaf/gemfire.119/product/jre
     /spiroc1/users/belindaf/gemfire.119/product/jre
     /bilbo1/users/belindaf/gemfire.119/product/jre
     /spiroc1/users/belindaf/gemfire.119/product/jre
   ;

Some things to consider when choosing hosts:
  -- You can place several GemFire systems on a host.
  -- Cache servers require less resources than edges; edges will 
     have at least 20 clients each.
  -- The cache servers are the first GemFire systems in the list
     (however many there are for a given test); the rest are edges.

These tests use 21 GemFire systems.  A configuration known to work
for Solaris is to have 4 edges per 2-CPU machine having 2G ram, or 
8 edges per 4-CPU machine with 4G ram.

Valid configurations for Windows is still under investigation.
To run with remote GemFire systems on a Windows machine, define a share
on a directory containing the product, hidden and test_classes
directories from a GemFire build. Include parameter settings
similar to these in your local.conf:

Note that this only works with separate UNIX boxes as Master and Server.
For example, the test configuration below would work as long as it wasn't
started from the system 'big'.  The start of MasterController must be on 
a separate UNIX box.

(//quill/gemfire30 is the Windows shared directory)
