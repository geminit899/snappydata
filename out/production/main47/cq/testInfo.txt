Below is the list of tests and their descriptions:-

1.cqListenerAndServerFailover.conf
In this test, feeders and servers are in the same Distributed System (peers). Edge clients are loners. The feeders feed the data to servers by doing put and putAll operations. Also region operations like put, putAll and remove are done on edges clients too. At the end of the test it is validated that that number of events generated by CQListener in the clients should be equal to the total number of operations performed. Note that there are no updates happening in the tests. Also invalidate and remove are happening on different sets of keys. Servers failover happens in this test. Servers are killed and brought up at regular time intervals.

2.multRegCQListener.conf
In this test, feeders and servers are in the same Distributed System (peers). Edge clients are loners. The feeders feed the data to servers by doing put and putAll operations. Also region operations like put, putAll and remove are done on edges clients too. At the end of the test it is validated that that number of events generated by CQListener in the clients should be equal to the total number of operations performed. Note that there are no updates happening in the tests. Also invalidate and remove are happening on different sets of keys. Servers failover DOES NOT happen in this test.

3.multRegCQListenerWithFeeder.conf
In this test, feeders and servers are in the same Distributed System (peers). Edge clients are loners. The feeders feed the data to servers by doing put and putAll operations. Also region operations like invalidate and remove are done on feeders too. At the end of the test it is validated that that number of events generated by CQListener in the clients should be equal to the number of operations performed on feeders. Note that there are no updates happening in the tests. Also invalidate and remove are happening on different sets of keys. Servers failover DOES NOT happen in this test.

4.multRegServerFailoverAndCQOps.conf
In this test, feeders and servers are in the same Distributed System (peers). Edge clients are loners. The feeders feed the data to servers by doing put and putAll operations. Also region operations like put, putAll, invalidate and remove are done on edges clients too. Along with region operations CQ operations namely excute, executeWithInitialResults, stop and close are done concurrently from edge clients. Servers failover happens in this test. Servers are killed and brought up at regular time intervals.

5.multRegCQOpsWithFeeder.conf
In this test, feeders and servers are in the same Distributed System (peers). Edge clients are loners. The feeders feed the data to servers by doing put and putAll operations. Also region operations like put, putAll, invalidate and remove are done on edges clients too. Along with region operations CQ operations namely excute, executeWithInitialResults, stop and close are done concurrently from edge clients. Servers failover DOES NOT happen in this test.

6.multRegCQOps.conf
In this test, Edge clients are loners. Region operations like put, putAll, invalidate and remove are done on edges clients too. Along with region operations CQ operations namely excute, executeWithInitialResults, stop and close are done concurrently from edge clients. ervers failover DOES NOT happen in this test.

7.edgesPerformingAllOps.conf
In this test, Edge clients are loners. Region operations like put, putAll, invalidate and remove are done on edges clients too. Along with region operations CQ operations namely excute, executeWithInitialResults, stop and close are done concurrently from edge clients. Servers failover DOES NOT happen in this test. Only single region is involved in this test as opposed to mutliple regions in test # 6.

8.dedicatedEdgesForCQOps.conf
In this test, there are two types of Edge clients. All Edge clients are loners. Region operations like put, putAll, invalidate and remove are done on first type of edges clients. And CQ operations namely excute, executeWithInitialResults, stop and close are done concurrently from another type of edge clients. Servers failover DOES NOT happen in this test. Only single region is involved in this test.

9.serverFailoverAndCQOps.conf
In this test, there are two types of Edge clients. All Edge clients are loners. Region operations like put, putAll, invalidate and remove are done on first type of edges clients. And CQ operations namely excute, executeWithInitialResults, stop and close are done concurrently from another type of edge clients. Servers failover happens in this test. Servers are killed and brought up at regular time intervals. Only single region is involved in this test.

Note:- the boolean “doExecuteWithInitialResultsCQ” is used in test # 7, 8, and 9 to specify if executeWithInitialResults need to be performed on CQ.
