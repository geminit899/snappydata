<P>The <b>WAN</b> example is an application that simulates two WAN sites, namely a US site
and an EU site. The example is located in the GemFire installation under
<code>examples/dist/wan</code>.</P>

<P>The WAN example contains the following four components:</P>

<UL>
<LI>A US WAN client that puts entries into a WAN-enabled region
<LI>A US WAN hub that receives those entries and distributes them to the EU WAN hub
<LI>An EU WAN hub that receives the distributed WAN events from the US hub and distributes them to its clients
<LI>An EU WAN client that receives the WAN events from the EU hub and displays them
</UL>

<P>In every shell used to run this example application, configure your
environment according to the instructions provided in
<a href="../../EnvSetup.html">examples/EnvSetup.html</a>.
</P>

<P>Once your environment is set, change to the
<code>examples/dist/wan</code> directory to run the
application.</P>

<P>To run the WAN example, perform the following steps:</P>

<OL>

<LI>Launch a shell for the US gateway hub
  <P>The US WAN hub is a cache server gateway to the EU WAN. This gateway forwards any client updates
to entries in the trades region to the EU WAN. Entry updates received from the EU WAN hub are
distributed to its clients.</P>
  <P>Change to the <code>examples/dist/wan/us-hub</code> directory and run the following command:</P>
<PRE>
cacheserver start
</PRE>
This command logs output like shown below:
<PRE>Starting CacheServer with pid: 18087
CacheServer pid: 18087 status: running
  </PRE>
  
<LI>Launch a shell for the EU gateway hub
  <P>The EU WAN hub is a cache server gateway to the US WAN. This gateway forwards any client updates
to entries in the trades region to the US WAN. Entry updates received from the US WAN hub will be
distributed to its clients.</P>
<P>Change to the <code>examples/dist/wan/eu-hub</code> directory and
run the following command:</P>
<PRE>
cacheserver start
</PRE>
This command logs output like shown below:

<PRE>Starting CacheServer with pid: 18686
CacheServer pid: 18686 status: running
</PRE>
<LI>Launch a shell for the EU client
<P>Change to the <code>examples/dist/wan/eu-client</code> directory and run the following command:.</P>
<P>The EU WAN client listens for updates to entries in trades region.</P>
<PRE>
java wan.WANClient eu
</PRE>

<P>The <code>WANClient</code> class has a <code>main</code> method
that creates either a US or EU WAN client using the 'us' or 'eu' parameters.
Shown below is the <code>WANClient</code> usage.</P>

<PRE>
$ java wan.WANClient

** Missing site name

usage: java wan.WANClient <site>
  site   The name of the WAN site (either 'us' or 'eu')

Launches a WAN client
</PRE>

<P>This command logs output like shown below:</P>
<PRE>
Created GemFire cache: eu-client
Retrieved region: com.gemstone.gemfire.internal.cache.LocalRegion[path='/trades';scope=LOCAL';data-type=NORMAL]
Registered interest in [] for region trades
</PRE>
<LI>Launch a shell for the US client
<P>The US WAN client launches mulitple threads, each putting entries into the trades region.</P>
<P>Change to the <code>examples/dist/wan/us-client</code> directory and run the following command:</P>
<PRE>
java wan.WANClient us
</PRE>

<P>This command logs output like shown below:</P>
<PRE>
Created GemFire cache: us-client

</PRE>
<LI>Stop the us-client and eu-client client VMs by pressing <code>CTRL-C</code> in both shells. Stop the us-hub and eu-hub cache server VMs
by entering <code>cacheserver stop</code> in their shells.
An example is shown below.
<PRE>
cacheserver stop
CacheServer stopped</PRE>
Close the four open shells by entering <code>exit</code> in each.
