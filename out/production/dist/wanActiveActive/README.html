<P>The <b>wan</b> example is an application that simulates two active WAN sites, namely a US site
and an EU site. To keep things simple each site has only one cache server.
The example shows the use of a conflict resolver to keep the two sites consistent.  The
resolver has several options for how conflicts are resolved that are set in the server cache.xml files.
The example is located in the GemFire installation under
<code>examples/dist/wanActiveActive</code>.</P>

<P>The WAN example contains the following six components:</P>

<UL>
<LI>A Locator service process for the US site
<LI>A Locator service process for the EU site
<LI>A US WAN client that puts entries into a WAN-enabled region
<LI>A EU WAN client that does the same
<LI>A US WAN server that receives entries from the US client and distributes them to the EU system
<LI>A EU WAN server that receives entries from the EU client and distributes them to the US system
</UL>

<P>In every shell used to run this example application, configure your
environment according to the instructions provided in
<a href="../../EnvSetup.html">examples/EnvSetup.html</a>.
</P>

<P>Once your environment is set, change to the
<code>examples/dist/wanActiveActive</code> directory to run the
application.</P>

<P>To run the WAN active-active example, perform the following steps:</P>

<OL>
<LI>Launch a shell for the US server
  <P>The US WAN server is a cache server with a sender to the EU WAN. This sender forwards any client updates
to entries in the trades region to the EU WAN. Entry updates received from the EU WAN sender are
distributed to its clients.</P>
  <P>Change to the <code>examples/dist/wanActiveActive/us-server</code> directory and run the following command:</P>
<PRE>
cacheserver start
</PRE>
This command logs output like shown below:
<PRE>Starting CacheServer with pid: 18087
CacheServer pid: 18087 status: running
  </PRE>
It also opens a GUI that will update every two seconds to show the current cache state and
the number of conflicts between the two systems that have been detected.
<p>  
  
<LI>Launch a shell for the EU server
  <P>The EU server has a gateway sender to the US distributed system. This gateway sender forwards any client updates
to entries in the trades region to the US server. Entry updates received from the US system will be
distributed to its clients.</P>
<P>Change to the <code>examples/dist/wanActiveActive/eu-server</code> directory and
run the following command:</P>
<PRE>
cacheserver start
</PRE>
This command logs output like shown below:

<PRE>Starting CacheServer with pid: 18686
CacheServer pid: 18686 status: running
</PRE>
This server also opens a GUI that will update every two seconds to show the current cache state and
the number of conflicts between the two systems that have been detected.  The number here may differ
from that in the other server because the timing of events can cause some events in one system to be
in conflict while they are not conflicting in the other syste,.
<p>
<LI>Launch a shell for the US client
<P>Change to the <code>examples/dist/wanActiveActive/us-client</code> directory and run the following command:.</P>
<P>The WAN client updates the same entry over and over again.</P>
<PRE>
java wanActiveActive.WANClient
</PRE>

<P>This command logs output like shown below:</P>
<PRE>

<LI>Launch a shell for the EU client 
<P>Like the US client the EU client updates the same entry over and over again.</P>
<P>Change to the <code>examples/dist/wanActiveActive/eu-client</code> directory and run the following command:</P>
<PRE>
java wanActiveActive.WANClient
</PRE>

<P>This command logs output like shown below:</P>

</PRE>

<P>When both clients are running at the same time there will be update conflicts.
These are intercepted in the servers and handed to the WAN gateway conflict
resolvers.  The resolver in each server will update its conflict-count in the
GUI dialog.</p>
The two systems update each other asynchronously so you will observe short intervals
where they do not appear to be in sync.  If you stop the clients you will observe
that the servers soon become consistent.  The clients can be stopped an restarted as
often as you like.
<p>
<LI>Examine the us-server/cacheserver.log file and you will find details of conflicts being
resolved by the WANConflictResolver example resolver class.  The output looks like this:
<PRE>
[info 2012/07/02 13:21:33.125 PDT  <ServerConnection on port 11111 Thread 0> tid=0x38] WANConflictResolver: 
  existing timestamp=1341260492865
  existing value=PDX[33554433,wanActiveActive.Value]{history=[PID=22516 count=4, PID=22516 count=3, PID=22516 count=2], merged=false, modification=PID=22516 count=4, modificationCount=4}
  proposed timestamp=1341260492376
  proposed value=PDX[33554433,wanActiveActive.Value]{history=[PID=22557 count=4, PID=22516 count=3, PID=22516 count=2], merged=false, modification=PID=22557 count=4, modificationCount=4}

[info 2012/07/02 13:21:33.126 PDT  <ServerConnection on port 11111 Thread 0> tid=0x38] event is older than cached value - disallowing event
</PRE>

<LI>Stop the us-server and eu-server cache server VMs
by entering <code>cacheserver stop</code> in their shells. Or by pressing the Close button in the GUI windows.
The clients will detect loss of the servers and exit.
An example is shown below.
<PRE>
cacheserver stop
CacheServer stopped</PRE>
Close the four open shells by entering <code>exit</code> in each. 
</OL>

<LI>The wanActiveActive cache servers can be modified to perform three different types of conflict resolution:
"use-latest", "merge" or "highest-int".  These are configured in cache.xml in the &LTgateway-conflict-resolver&GT
settings:
<pre>
  &LTgateway-conflict-resolver&GT
    &LTclass-name&GTwanActiveActive.WANConflictResolver&LT/class-name&GT
    &LTparameter name="resolution-type"&GT
      &LTstring&GT<font color="blue">merge</font>&LT/string&GT
    &LT/parameter&GT
</pre>
To select a different resolution algorithm stop the hubs as described above and edit the
us-server/cache.xml and eu-server/cache.xml files to change the resolution-type parameter.

<p>The default is "use-latest", which keeps the most recent change.  If two
changes happen to have the exact same timestamp then the distributed-system ID is checked and the EU hub is
allowed to prevail.

<p>"merge" resolution attempts to merge the conflicting events, though it may cause their contents to be slightly
out of order in the two systems.  When this resolution is in effect a flag is set on the merged value so that clients
can tell that the value has been tampered with.  The clients look for this and will display
<pre>
current value was merged by conflict resolver: { id=5, str='PID=23728 count=5', merged=true, 
history=['PID=23770 count=5''PID=23728 count=5''PID=23728 count=4''
</pre>
In this case you can see that there are two count=5 entries that were both based on a count=4 and that
the two changes were preserved in the merge.

<p>"highest-int" will attempt to keep the value with the highest modification count.  Each time a client modifies
the cached object it increments the modification count, so this will attempt to preserve the most operations
performed on the object.
