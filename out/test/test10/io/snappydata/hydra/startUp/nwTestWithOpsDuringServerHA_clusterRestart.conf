hydra.Prms-testRequirement = "Test to verify persistent Column tables functionality with
executing and verifying the different ddl and dml ops during server HA and
cluster restart using north wind schema";
hydra.Prms-testDescription = "
This test starts the snappy cluster and spark cluster.
Test then runs the sql script for creating and loading data in persistent column tables using
northwind schema and data.
It then kills one of the server, execute ddl and dml ops, drops one of the existing table from
northWind schema(e.g. orders), recreate and loads the table data, restarts the killed server and
then stops and restarts the cluster and
verify that the cluster restarts successfully.
Test then executes queries on all tables and verify that the queries executed successfully.
