hydra.Prms-testRequirement = "Test to verify Persistent Column tables functionality with locator HA
and cluster restart";
hydra.Prms-testDescription = "
This test starts the snappy cluster and spark cluster.
Test then runs the sql script for creating and loading data in Persistent column tables using
northwind schema and data.
It then stops all locators.
After stopping all locator vms, test executes ddl and dml ops using server connection and then stop
and restarts the snappy cluster.
Snappy job executes and validate the northwind queries on the tables created and loaded through split mode.
At the end test verifies that cluster restart is successful and verifies queries are successful on
table created and loaded after stopping locators.";
