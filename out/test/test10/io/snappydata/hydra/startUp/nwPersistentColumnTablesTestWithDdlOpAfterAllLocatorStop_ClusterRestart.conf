using north wind schema";
hydra.Prms-testDescription = "
This test starts the snappy cluster and spark cluster.
Test then runs the sql script for creating and loading data in Persistent column tables using
northwind schema and data.
It then executes the spark app for executing and validating northwind queries on the tables
created and loaded through snappy shell.
It then executes the snappy job and sql script in parallel along with locator HA and cluster
restart.
After stopping all locator vms, test executes ddl op using server connection and then stop and
restarts the snappy cluster.
Snappy job executes and validate the northwind queries on the tables created and loaded through split mode.
sql script only executes the northwind queries on the tables created and loaded through snappy
shell.
At the end test verifies that cluster restart is successful.";
