hydra.Prms-testDescription = "
This test starts the snappy cluster.
Test then spawns the 100 jdbc clients to run the point lookup and analytical queries concurrently
 with data size of 10 GB of northWind data.
It then verifies how many concurrent queries with mix of both point lookup queries and aggregate
queries can be executed in the same time span";
