hydra.Prms-testDescription = "
This test starts the snappy cluster.
Test then spawns the specified number of jdbc clients to run the point lookup and analytical
queries concurrently with data size of 10 GB of TPCH data.
It then verifies how many concurrent queries with mix of both point lookup queries and aggregate
queries can be executed in the same time span";
