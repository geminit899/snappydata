hydra.Prms-testRequirement = "Test to measure performance of querying when concurrency goes up and data is being added/changed/deleted";
hydra.Prms-testDescription = " This test starts the snappy cluster.
Test then spawns the specified number of jdbc clients to run the analytical
queries concurrently with airline data of 220 million records.
Test also performs continuous inserts and updates through streaming concurrently with analytical queries execution.
Inserts and updates happening at the interval of 0.1 secs and numRows getting inserted updated in one batch are 1K.
It then verifies how many concurrent analytical queries can be executed in the 15 minutes time span
with varying number of threads executing these queries concurrently through JDBC connection.
